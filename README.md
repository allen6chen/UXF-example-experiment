UXF-Unity Experiment Framework enables users to conduct human behaviour experiments in Unity Engine including VR, desktop and Web baed experiments.([https://immersivecognition.com/projects/uxf-unity-experiment-framework/](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework)) (UXF) This tutorial will go through the steps necessary to integrate UXF with Unity, from installing the Unity Editor to creating a scene with an imported package to completing a ... task.
This tutorial is designed such that you do not need prior experience with Unity or C# in order to follow the scene setup steps, and you do not need prior robotics experience to get started with ROS integration. The tutorial is divided into high-level phases, from basic Unity and ROS initial setup through executing a pick-and-place task.
